# Linear Regression on Car Prices

This repository contains two approaches to performing linear regression on a dataset of car prices. The first approach uses the Scikit-learn library, and the second approach implements linear regression without using Scikit-learn. Both approaches yield approximately the same results, demonstrating the effectiveness of linear regression in predicting car prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `data.csv`, which contains various features related to car specifications and their respective prices.

## Project Structure

- `sklearn_linear_regression.py`: Linear regression implementation using Scikit-learn.
- `manual_linear_regression.py`: Linear regression implementation without using Scikit-learn.
- `data.csv`: Dataset containing car features and prices.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rickyy-Sam07/Linear-Regression.git
cd Linear-Regression

##Install the required Python packages:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

##Conclusion
This project illustrates two different methods for performing linear regression on a car price dataset. Using Scikit-learn simplifies the process and provides built-in functions for model training and evaluation, while the manual implementation offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of linear regression.
